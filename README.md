Reuben is a BaSH command line utility that helps you get started with your Flask project by just giving your project's name.

### Usage
1. Download the script.
2. Run ``` chmod +x reuben.sh ``` to make it executable.
3. Run ```./reuben.sh``` and follow the instructions!

The project structure is inspired from this [article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-flask-a-python-microframework).
