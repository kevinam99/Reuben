# Reuben

I wanted to quickly get started with a new Flask project as a beginner. But I found setting the project manually was a waste of time. I don't want to go through the same thing every time I decide to start a new Flas project. So, I created Reuben.

Reuben is a BaSH command line utility that helps you get started with your Flask project by just giving your project's name.

### Usage
1. Download the script.
2. Run ``` chmod +x reuben.sh ``` to make it executable.
3. Run ```./reuben.sh``` and follow the instructions!

### Add Reuben to your PATH

- Save the script as reuben (without the .sh extension) in some ~/bin.
- Add $$ \sim $$/bin to your PATH, typing export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
- If you need it permanently, add that last line in your ~/.bashrc. If you're using zsh, then add it to ~/.zshrc instead.
- Then you can just run ```reuben``` and it will run anywhere

Note that if you ```export``` the PATH variable in a specific window it won't update in other bash instances. See [this answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20054809)


The project structure is inspired from this [Scotch.io article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-flask-a-python-microframework).
